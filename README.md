# NinjaCoach


These files contain the raw code for the NinjaCoach.me app and the SynthesisRecruiting App. 

In the Synthesis Recruiting Files, you can find the raw code to my SynthesisRecruiting.com website which captures data, ranks workers by qualification and integrates with firebase and hubspot CRM via zapier. 

In the NinjaCoach Folder the index.html file will reveal the main html page for the Ninjacoach.me web app, which has been built and tested in firefox at present, and is not designed to be responsive for ipad or phones.   It is designed for computers.  It will, however, track your goals and progress toward them and coach you on any of them.  It is still being built frame by frame and tested by myself, and to date NO UX attention has been invested into it.  Perhaps soon...
